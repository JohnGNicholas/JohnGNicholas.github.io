  <h1>LEAPP: Lower-Limb Extendable and Affordable Pediatric Pylon</h1>
  
  <p>Winning the 2017 Purdue University Biomedical Engineering Senior Design competition, I designed, manufactured, and tested an adjustable prosthetic pylon for pediatric patients in developing countries.

  <p>A prosthetic pylon is an oft-overlooked component of a leg prosthesis which replaces the tibia and fibula bones of the lower leg:</p>

  <p>As children grow and develop, their tibiae and fibulae grow rapidly; for children requiring prostheses, this necessitates replacement of traditional pylons as frequently as every 6 months.
  Without replacement, children will be at risk to develop biomechanical problems such as hip misalignment and spinal pain.
    <br><br>
  Due to its adjustability, LEAPP is more economical than the traditional static pylon replacement process.
  LEAPP conforms to the strength requirements for leg prostheses outlined in the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/70205.html">ISO 10328:2016 standard</a> and would likely be considered a 510(k) exempt, class 1-designated product by the FDA.
