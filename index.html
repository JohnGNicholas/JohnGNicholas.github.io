<p>Hello, Iâ€™m John Nicholas. I am an engineer who is passionate about mechatronics, scientific computing, mechanical design, and biomedical technology. 
I just completed an internship as a Robotics Design Engineer at <a href='https://www.bastiansolutions.com' target="_blank">Bastian Solutions</a> Autonomous Vehicles in Georgetown, Kentucky.
  <br><br>
My previous work includes electronic health record data integration at <a href='https://www.epic.com' target="_blank">Epic</a>, sustainable prostheses for patients in developing countries, and research on bone and muscle tissue engineering.
I'm currently working on a Master's degree in mechanical engineering at Purdue University, where I am studying linear and nonlinear control systems, programming with ROS, building neural networks, and more!
