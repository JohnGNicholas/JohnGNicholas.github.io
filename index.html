<p>Hello, I’m John Nicholas. I am an engineer who is passionate about embedded systems, scientific computing, mechanical design, healthcare, and medical devices. 
I am seeking internship opportunities in mechanical or biomedical engineering with a focus on controls and electromechanical systems.
  <br><br>
My previous work includes electronic health record data integration at <a href='https://www.epic.com' target="_blank">Epic</a>, sustainable prostheses for patients in developing countries, and research on bone and muscle tissue engineering.
I’m currently expanding my engineering knowledge base as a post-baccalaureate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
In Fall 2020, I expect to begin a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University.
