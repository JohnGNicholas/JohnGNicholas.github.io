  <h1>Mass-Spring System Simulation</h1>
  <p>An ideal one-dimensional mass-spring system contains a mass (m) connected to a Hooke's Law spring with spring constant k.
  This script utilizes Euler's method to simulate the position and velocity of the mass given initial conditions.
  A diagram of this system is shown below:</p>

  <p>This simulation describes the motion of the system when released from an initial compression. 
    The initial position of the mass for this simulation is a compression of 0.1 m.
    The mass is released from rest, so the initial velocity is 0 m/s.
    <br><br>
    The output of the simulation is displayed in position-time and velocity-time charts below.
    As this is an ideal system with no friction or damping elements, the mass will oscillate indefinitely.
