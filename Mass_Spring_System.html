  <h1>Mass-Spring System Simulation</h1>
  <p>An ideal one-dimensional mass-spring system contains a mass (m) connected to a Hooke's Law spring with spring constant k.
  This script utilizes Euler's method to simulate the position and velocity of the mass given initial conditions.
  A diagram of this system is shown below:</p>

  <p>
    The only force present in this system is the spring force, which is proportional and opposite to the displacement:
    <br><br>
    &Sum;F = ma = -kx
    <br><br>
    Solving for acceleration and substituting a=d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup>:
    <br><br>
    d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> = -kx/m
    <br><br>
    We will replace this second-order ordinary differential equation with a system of two first-order ODEs by defining v, the derivative of x:
    <br><br>
    dx/dt = v
    <br>
    dv/dt = d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> = -kx/m
    <br><br>
    We will use Euler's method to approximate x(t) and v(t) using a step size of 'dt':
    <br><br>
    v(t+dt) = v(t) + dv/dt(t)*dt = v(t) + [-kx(t)/m]*dt
    <br>
    x(t+dt) = x(t) + dx/dt(t)*dt = x(t) + v(t)*dt
    <br><br>
    This simulation describes the motion of the system when released from an initial compression. 
    The initial position of the mass for this simulation is a compression of 0.1 m.
    The mass is released from rest, so the initial velocity is 0 m/s.
    <br><br>
    The output of the simulation is displayed in position-time and velocity-time charts below.
    As this is an ideal system with no friction or damping elements, the mass will oscillate indefinitely.
